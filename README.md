# Security Toolbox ðŸ§°

> Welcome to my security toolbox repo! This will hold everything from dotfiles, to application configs, to helpful scripts that I use while working on security challenges or personal projects. 

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

To hold and make my toolbox publicly accessible for people learning security or just looking for a tool to solve a problem. Most will have simple explainations alongside them to show you why I am using that tool or why I have set an application up a particular way.
